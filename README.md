To run the program, run Simulation.py
The GUI controls certain variables from the simulation game.
The plot is currently in the same widget as the sliders, I can still separate the two but I jsut wanted to see if I could plot some data.
flask_test & pandas_test are made to get familiar with the two libraries, they contribute nothing to the simulation.
