To run the program, run Simulation.py<br /><br />
The GUI controls certain variables from the simulation game.<br />
The plot is currently in the same widget as the sliders, I can still separate the two but I jsut wanted to see if I could plot some data.<br /><br />
flask_test & pandas_test are made to get familiar with the two libraries, they contribute nothing to the simulation.<br />
